            <p>3G provides commercial five aside football pitches, providing pitch bookings for
                either football teams, friendlies or even for a casual kick about. We were founded
                in Peterborough in 2015, since then we’ve had a lot of success within the local
                area. 3G are now looking to expand and create at least another two more facilities
                based in the Midlands. </p>
            <p>There are plans underway at the Peterborough facility to add an additional three more
                pitches, including one 7-aside pitch. We have worked on projects to bring the
                community together and doing so have received a lot of success, allowing a vibrant,
                fun and friendly place for people to play the sport they have a passion for.</p>
            <p>We strive to use football as the vocal point, to bring diverse backgrounds together,
                allowing communities to share the love of football, without any judgement or
                prejudice, opening the doors for all backgrounds regardless of their race, religion,
                gender and more, it’s totally open to anyone who wants to play. </p>
            <p>We are innovators steamrolling our way into the industry with you, the customers, at
                the middle of everything we do. With inventive minds bringing an exhilarating
                variety of industry first products and our helpful team always striving to improve
                standards, there surely is no better footballing community to share the journey
                with.</p>
            <p>We have top of the range facilities, with a 3G football pitch that is maintained by
                our well trained groundsmen who has been working in the football industry for almost
                20 years. Some of the top material is used to layer our football pitches, with 3G
                grass and rubber material to help provide a comfortable and safe playing
                surface. </p>
            <p>We now have our new up and running website, if you are interested in pre-ordering a
                pitch with us, to ensure you don’t miss out, register an account with us, then
